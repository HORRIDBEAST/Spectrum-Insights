# Spectrum-Insights
This is an AI-based model, named SpectrumInsights, to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in individuals based on demographic and clinical data, with the reported accuracy of 87% for the model. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) was applied for the problem of class imbalance during which it improved the ASD detection rates by 20%. Many classification models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost were developed as part of the project, and hyperparameter tuning was performed using RandomizedSearchCV, resulting in the best model achieving a 95% cross-validation accuracy. The model is deployed in Streamlit offering a user-friendly interface ensuring rapid and reliable predictions in relation to ASD.
